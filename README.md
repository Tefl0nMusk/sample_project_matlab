CI with Jenkins trial 1

Got a plugin called GitHub pull req builder which triggers the build whenever it recieves a POST from github webhook. So I linked my github to the Jenkis plugin and made a webhook. Since I got my Jenkins on localhost thats not accessible to the public on internet I got a small CLI application called socketxp which converts the localhost to publicly accessible link. I used this to create a webhook and redirect it to Jenkins. But, it sends the requests but Jenkins plugin is not able to catch the sent POSTs


# Github Workflow 

 We follow [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) using branches for new work and pull requests for verifying the work.
 
 
 The steps for a new piece of work can be summarised as follows:
   1. Push up or create an issue 
   2. Create a branch from master using the naming convention described at *Naming Branches*
   3. Do the work and commit changes to the newly created branch. On commit, the pre-commit framework will run, it will check all your changes for formatting, linting, and perform static code analysis. 
   4. Push the branch regularly to GitHub to make sure no work is accidentally lost.
   5. When you are finished with the work, ensure that all of the unit tests, documentation tests and system tests if necessary pass on your own machine
   6. Open a pull request (Pull Requests) from the GitHub branches page
   7. This will check with the buildservers for cross-platform compatibility
   8. If any issues come up, continue working on your branch and push to GitHub - the pull request will update automatically
 
# Naming Branches
When naming public branches that will be pushed to GitHub, please follow the convention of 'issuenumber_short_description'. This will allow others to discover what the branch is for (issue number) and quickly know what is being done there (short description).

#### Example: '32125_extract_load_from_rilap'


# Pull Requests
For an general overview of using pull requests on GitHub look here.

When creating a pull request you should:

1. Ensure that the title succinctly describes the changes so it is easy to read on the overview page
2. The title should not contain the issue number
3. [Reference the issue which the pull request is closing](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests), using one of [these](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages) keywords
4. State the user and facility (if relevant) who initiated the original issue, if they are named in the issue. Please do not put full email addresses on the Pull Request, as it is publicly accessible. If the user would not be easily identified by someone picking up the ticket, be prepared to act as a point of contact with the reporter.
5. Ensure the description follows the format described by the Pull Request template below

A good example from Mantid Project is [This](https://github.com/mantidproject/mantid/pull/18713)

# Pull Request Template

#### To test:

Fixes #xxxx.

#### Reviewer
* Please comment on the following (full description):

#### Code Review

* If there are changes in the release notes then do they describe the changes appropriately?
#### Functional Tests
* Do changes function as described? Add comments below that describe the tests performed?
